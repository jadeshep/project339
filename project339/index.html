		<h1>Suicide Prevention and Awareness</h1>
		<h2>Suicide is preventable. </h2>

		<p>Understanding the issues concerning suicide and mental health is an important way to take part in suicide prevention, help others in crisis, and 
			change the conversation around suicide.</p>
			<hr>
		<p> Suicide is related to brain functions that affect decision-making and behavioral control, making it difficult for people to find positive solutions.<br><br>
			Limiting a person’s access to methods of killing themselves dramatically decreases suicide rates in communities.<br><br>
			Ninety percent of people who die by suicide have an underlying — and potentially treatable — mental health condition.<br><br>
			Depression, bipolar disorder, and substance use are strongly linked to suicidal thinking and behavior.<br><br>
			Specific treatments used by mental health professionals — such as Cognitive Behavior Therapy-SP and Dialectical Behavior Therapy — have been proven to help people manage their suicidal ideation and behavior.<br><br>
			No one takes their life for a single reason. Life stresses combined with known risk factors, such as childhood trauma, substance use — or even chronic physical pain — can contribute to someone taking their life.<br><br>
			Asking someone directly if they’re thinking about suicide won’t “put the idea in their head” — most will be relieved someone starts a conversation.<br><br>
			Certain medications used to treat depression or stabilize mood have been proven to help people reduce suicidal thoughts and behavior.<br><br>
			If someone can get through the intense, and short, moment of active suicidal crisis, chances are they will not die by suicide.<br><br>
			Most people who survive a suicide attempt (85 to 95 percent) go on to engage in life.</p>
