    <h1>Reaching Out</h1>

    <p>"Are you thinking of ending your life?" Few phrases are as difficult to say to a loved one.
        But when it comes to suicide prevention, none are more important. Here are some ways to get the conversation started.</p>
    </header>

    <div class="convo-image">
      <img src="imgs/serious-convo.jpg" alt="start-the-conversation"/>
    </div>
    
    <div class="convo text-block3">
      <a id="convo"></a>
      <h2>Start the conversation</h2>
      <p>Before starting a conversation with someone you are concerned about, be prepared. Have a list of crisis resources on hand. Practice what you will say. 
          Plan the conversation for a time when you wonâ€™t be in a hurry and can spend time with the person.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="listen-image">
      <img src="imgs/reassurance.jpg" alt="reassurance"/>
    </div>

    <div class="listen text-block3">
      <a id="listen"></a>
      <h2>Listen, express concern, and reassure</h2>
      <p>Listen to the reasons the person has for both living and dying. Validate that they are considering both options and underscore that living is an option 
          for them.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="plan-image">
      <img src="imgs/making-plan.jpg" alt="making-plan"/>
    </div>

    <div class="plan text-block3">
      <a id="plan"></a>
      <h2>Make a Safety Plan</h2>
      <p>Ask the person if they have access to any lethal means (weapons, medications, etc) and help remove them from the vicinity. (Another friend, family member 
          or law enforcement agent may be needed to assist with this.) Do not put yourself in danger; if you are concerned about your own safety, call 911.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="help-image">
      <img src="imgs/get-help.jpeg" alt ="get-help"/>
    </div>

    <div class="help text-block3">
      <a id="help"></a>
      <h2>Get Help</h2>
      <p>Provide the person with the resources you have come prepared with. Call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline anytime at 1-800-273-8255. 
            If you feel the situation is critical, take the person to a nearby Emergency Room or walk-in psychiatric crisis clinic or call 9-1-1.</p>
